# hello-world
Me, Its all about me and what i think.

Hey its me vivek, today I feel very bad about myself as I didn't get into Missouri University of Science & Technology and Arizona State University. I just don't know what to do. I have only 4 chances remaining now. I should get San Jose State University or SUNY Binghamton University. I don't know what i am going to do with my life. Will I be able to get into any college? 

Now I am learning python language, lets see what happens. Will this be useful in my future? I guess it is. Lets see.
